description: Use when configuring, creating, updating, validating, troubleshooting, read-only scoring, or drafting outbound smart-Agent prompts for Shandian Intelligent admin IVR workflows at ai.sd6g.com:1904, especially tasks involving arbitrary source-document to outbound prompt generation, 话术配置, 智能Agent/智能节点, /api/web IVR APIs, sceneList/sceneListFrontend, prompt Markdown import, llmNodeModelConfig, intent/port mapping, terminal/hangup intents, smart-Agent audit scoring, or direct Bearer token API calls without logging in. For ordinary-node TalkTrack-Master work, use the talktrack-master skill instead.

# TalkTrack-Agent

Use this TalkTrack-series skill to operate the Shandian Intelligent smart-Agent layer by API, not by logging into the page. The default path is: the user provides a valid `Bearer` token, validate it with `/account/findInfo`, then call `/api/web` endpoints directly.

## Boundary

- Use this skill for smart Agent / smart-node work: arbitrary source-document to outbound prompt drafting, IVR creation, prompt import, `llmNodeModelConfig`, intent rules, graph port mappings, terminal / hangup intents, and read-only smart-Agent audits.
- Use `talktrack-master` for TalkTrack-Master ordinary-node work: normal / jump / end nodes, system TTS, knowledge-base answer TTS, NLP / knowledge-base matching, and ordinary-node large-model intent analysis 2.0.
- When one request mixes both layers, split the work by ownership and state which skill owns each layer before reading or writing backend data.

## Non-Negotiables

- Do not use the login page or captcha flow unless there is no valid token and the user explicitly asks for login troubleshooting.
- Do not print, store in docs, or repeat real tokens/passwords in final answers.
- Use request header `token: Bearer <TOKEN>`, not `Authorization`.
- Verify token first with `GET /account/findInfo`; continue only when `code=0`.
- Default to read-only API calls unless the user explicitly authorizes backend modification and the target IVR / node / intent scope is clear.
- Document-to-prompt conversion is draft-only by default. Do not import a generated prompt into the backend until the user explicitly approves the generated prompt package and target IVR / node.
- For write operations, create or use a test/new IVR unless the user explicitly asks to modify an existing production IVR.
- For `updateSceneList`, snapshot existing config first and verify by reading it back.
- Keep raw JSON, full backend snapshots, and large exported artifacts under `D:\闪电智能\tmp`; write durable reports and SOP summaries to the formal Obsidian vault when the user asks for an artifact.
- On Windows, do not use Windows PowerShell 5 for Chinese JSON write requests or inline Chinese payloads; use a UTF-8 Python script or UTF-8 files. PowerShell 5 may mojibake Chinese names/prompts.
- When configuring, checking, or importing a prompt that contains `intent`, read `references/intent-usage-rules.md` first and enforce it against the prompt plus IVR ports/mappings.
- Enforce terminal-closing ownership. If a smart Agent terminal `intent` maps to a later hangup / end node, the Agent must only say a short acknowledgement plus `{"intent":"..."}`; the formal closing sentence, goodbye, handoff promise, and repeated business details belong to the downstream terminal node. Only let the Agent speak the full closing when there is no downstream terminal node that will speak it.

## Quick Workflow

0. Classify the task mode before touching APIs: document-to-prompt drafting, smart Agent creation, prompt import, read-only audit, intent / port check, terminal / hangup check, `llmNodeModelConfig` check, or prompt readback validation.
1. Extract token from the user's curl or message.
   - Prefer `-H 'token: Bearer ...'`.
   - If only cookie is present, URL decode `token=Bearer%20...`.
2. Validate:
   - `GET https://ai.sd6g.com:1904/api/web/account/findInfo`
   - Header: `token: Bearer <TOKEN>`
3. Read base resources:
   - `GET /industry/findList`
   - `GET /ivr/findAllTtsVoiceBaseInfo`
   - `GET /ivr/findModelList`
   - `POST /ivr/findPage` with `{"query":{"searchName":""},"page":{"current":1,"size":10}}`
4. Create IVR with `/ivr/insert`, or read the target IVR if updating.
5. For smart Agent nodes, clone a known-good scene graph shape from an existing IVR, then replace only business fields.
6. If the prompt contains `intent`, read `references/intent-usage-rules.md`; verify non-hangup intents use current node IDs, hangup intents are exactly the four allowed terminal labels, and labels match IVR ports.
7. Import prompt Markdown as UTF-8. If the prompt is under 10,000 characters, write it unchanged; only compact when it is 10,000+ characters or a readback-verified write fails with `话术场景信息异常`.
8. Verify with `/ivr/findSceneList/{ivrId}` and, when useful, open `/script-graph?ivrId=<ivrId>`.
9. Delete temporary token files or auth dumps.

## Task Modes

Choose one primary mode and keep the run inside that mode unless the user expands scope:

- `smart-agent-create`: create or assemble an IVR smart Agent from approved source material. Requires explicit write authorization.
- `doc-to-outbound-prompt`: convert arbitrary source documents into an outbound smart-Agent prompt draft. Draft-only; no backend writes.
- `prompt-package-review`: review a generated prompt package for factual grounding, intent rules, privacy risk, length, and import readiness.
- `prompt-import`: import a Markdown prompt into an existing smart node and validate prompt readback. Requires explicit write authorization.
- `readonly-audit`: inspect existing IVR / smart-node configuration without backend writes.
- `smart-agent-score`: run the smart-Agent read-only audit scorer and produce P0 / P1 / P2 findings plus next-step recommendations.
- `intent-port-check`: verify intent labels, graph ports, terminal nodes, and backend / frontend / graph consistency.
- `terminal-hangup-check`: verify hangup / terminal intent labels follow the four-label rule in `intent-usage-rules.md`.
- `terminal-closing-overlap-check`: verify terminal intent examples in the prompt do not duplicate downstream hangup / end-node closing copy.
- `llm-config-check`: verify `llmNodeModelConfig` exists and is consistent across backend, frontend, and graph custom data.
- `prompt-readback-check`: compare prompt length / hash / required sections against the approved source prompt without printing sensitive prompt material unless the user asks.

## Bundled Scripts

- Use `scripts/create_doushen_real_prompt_ivr.py` for "create a new IVR from a stable template + import a UTF-8 prompt" tasks when its parameters fit. It validates the token, clones the template graph, writes raw prompts under 10,000 characters unchanged, falls back to compacted prompt only after length/failure, and reports `promptStrategy`, `promptWrittenChars`, hashes, readback matches, port labels, and terminal nodes.
- Run bundled scripts with a token argument only for the current task; do not hardcode real tokens into scripts, docs, commits, or examples.

## Key API Rules

- Base URL: `https://ai.sd6g.com:1904/api/web`
- IVR pagination payload must be:

```json
{"query":{"searchName":""},"page":{"current":1,"size":10}}
```

- New IVR minimal payload:

```json
{"voiceType":1,"ttsVoiceId":1,"speechRate":1,"name":"<name>","industryId":42}
```

- Smart Agent node type is `type: 4`.
- Agent model config lives at `llmNodeModelConfig`.
- For Chinese scene names, node names, prompts, and graph JSON on Windows, prefer Python `requests` with `json=...`, `ensure_ascii=False`, and explicit UTF-8 file reads/writes. Avoid PowerShell 5 inline Chinese strings for write calls.
- Keep backend and frontend copies in sync:
  - `sceneList[0].nodeList[0]`
  - `sceneListFrontend[0].nodeList[0]`
  - `sceneListFrontend[0].graph.cells[0].data.customData`
